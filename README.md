# DevOps Forum 2020 - StoreLocator Demo
This is my session for Global Azure Greece 2020, title "Poor-man's cloud native architectures" using Azure service in the most cost-effective manner to create a scalable cloud-native/serverless application costing no more than a beer a month. As the scenario, we used a fictional store locator to demonstrate all components used in such an application.

The services used by this application are:
- Azure Functions
- API Management
- Azure Active Directory B2C
- Cosmos DB
- Blob Storage
- Azure Search

If you want to try out and experiment with this application, you can directly deploy it on your Azure subscription clicking the button below:
